In this work, I conducted dynamic causal modeling between V1 and Fusiform Gyrus at subject level. 4 models were created for comparison: 1. no influence 2. top-down only 3. bottom-up only 4. both  <br>

Then I plotted the winning model (including the parameters and the probabilities P(parameter > 0)) and reported the Bayes factors (exp(relative log-evidence)) and the confidence level of your model selection.  <br>

My report: <br>
